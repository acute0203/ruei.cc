*  The `font-family` property defines the typeface of an element.
*  `font-size` controls the size of text displayed.
*  `font-weight` defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
*  The `text-align` property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
*  Text can have two different color attributes: `color` and `background-color`. `color` defines the color of the text, while `background-color` defines the color behind the text.
*  CSS can make an element transparent with the `opacity` property.
*  CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the `background-image` property.
